1. Training the YOLOv11 Model on Custom Data
To train YOLOv11, you need a dataset with images and corresponding annotation files in YOLO format. The dataset configuration is stored in a .yaml file, which specifies the paths to the training and validation datasets, along with class names.

Steps:
Prepare Dataset: Ensure your dataset has two folders:

train/ → Contains images/ and labels/ subfolders.

valid/ → (Optional) For validation images and labels.

Create dataset.yaml: This file should contain the paths to the dataset folders and class names. If validation data is missing, you can train only on the training set.

Train the Model: The training process is executed using Ultralytics' YOLO library. Important parameters include:

epochs: Number of training iterations.

batch size: Number of images processed per step.

device: Specifies whether to use CPU or GPU.

2. Saving the Trained Model
Once training is complete, the model's weights are saved automatically. You can export the model to different formats such as TorchScript, ONNX, or TensorRT for deployment.

model.export(format="torchscript") converts the trained model to a TorchScript format, making it compatible with PyTorch for inference without requiring the full Ultralytics framework.

3. Loading and Running the Model on a Video
After training, the model can be loaded and used for object detection or tracking in a video.

Steps:
Load the trained model: Use the saved model weights to initialize YOLO.

Open a video file: Read frames from a video for processing.

Run inference: Perform object detection or tracking on each frame.

Visualize results: Annotate frames with detected objects and save the output video.
